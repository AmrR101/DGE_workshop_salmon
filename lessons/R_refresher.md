## Getting started

**Exercise:**

1 Create a new project called `R_refresher`

* Load the tidyverse and ggplot2 libraries
* Create the following folders in the project directory - `data`, `figures`
* Download a counts file to the `data` folder by [right-clicking here]()
* Use `read.csv()` to read in the downloaded file and save it in the object/variable `counts`
* What is the data structure of `counts`?
* Summarize the contents of the `meta` object, how many data types are represented?
* Create a data frame called `meta` that looks like the table shown below:
  
* Add row names to the `meta` data frame, and have them be identical to the column names in `counts`
* Create a list called `project1` with the `meta` and `counts` objects
